Before using your chatbot, you must configure its settings, including the `System prompt`, `model`, `API key` (optional), `title` and `Welcome Message`.


### System Prompt

Defines the system prompt for this chatbot.


### Model

We currently support three models:

- **llama-3-8b** (temporarily free)
- **gpt-3.5-turbo** (requires an OpenAI API key)
- **gpt-4-0125-preview** (requires an OpenAI API key)

### API Key
When utilizing GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, it's essential to obtain an API key directly from the [OpenAI official website](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

### Title
This will be the title of the chat dialog.

### Welcome Message

The first message users see when they start chatting.

After configuring these settings, you can start conversing immediately.
